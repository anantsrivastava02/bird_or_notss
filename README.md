### README: Bird or Forest Detection using Fastai

---

#### Project Overview

Welcome to the **Bird or Forest Detection** project! This project leverages the Fastai library to create a model that can distinguish between images of birds and forests. This README will guide you through setting up the project, understanding the code, and running the model.

#### Introduction

This project uses the Fastai library, built on top of PyTorch, to train a neural network that can classify images into two categories: **bird** or **forest**. The Fastai library provides high-level APIs that make it simple to build and train models with state-of-the-art performance.

#### Installation

To get started, you need to have Python installed on your machine. We recommend using Python 3.7 or higher. Follow the steps below to set up your environment:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bird-forest-detection.git
    cd bird-forest-detection
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

#### Dataset Preparation

1. **Download the dataset:**

    You need a dataset containing images of birds and forests. You can create your own dataset or use a publicly available one. Ensure that the dataset is organized in the following structure:

    ```
    dataset/
    ├── train/
    │   ├── birds/
    │   └── forests/
    ├── valid/
    │   ├── birds/
    │   └── forests/
    ```

2. **Place the dataset in the project directory:**

    Move the `dataset` folder into the root directory of the project.

#### Training the Model

To train the model, follow these steps:

1. **Run the training script:**

    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

    The `train.py` script will load the dataset, create a Fastai `DataLoaders` object, and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the data using a `resnet15` architecture.

2. **Monitor the training process:**

    The script will output training progress, including loss and accuracy metrics. You can also visualize the training process using Fastai's built-in tools.

---

#### Inference

Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on new images. Follow these steps:

1. **Run the inference script:**

    ```bash
    python inference.py path_to_image.jpg
    ```

    Replace `path_to_image.jpg` with the path to the image you want to classify.

2. **View the results:**

    The script will output whether the image is classified as a bird or a forest.
